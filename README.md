# Python string sort.
A project I started when I got fustrated with pythons sorting of numbers in strings.</br>
This script takes in a array/list of strings that are numbers in string form or contain numbers and will sort them in order.

## Planned Development:
I plan on continuosly working on this project until I am completely happy with it.</br>
I plan on adding a reverse sorting to this as well. </br>

## Adding to the project.
If you would like to work on this with me please reach out!
